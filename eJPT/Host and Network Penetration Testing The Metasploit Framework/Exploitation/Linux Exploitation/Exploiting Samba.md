## Lab

The target server as described below is running a vulnerable file sharing server. Your task is to fingerprint the application using command line tools available on the Kali terminal and then exploit the application using the appropriate Metasploit module. Get a shell on the target!

Instructions:Â 

- This lab is dedicated to you! No other users are on this network :)
- Once you start the lab, you will have access to a root terminal of a Kali instance
- Your Kali has an interface with IP address 192.X.Y.Z. Run "ip addr" to know the values of X and Y.
- The target server should be located at the IP address 192.X.Y.3.
- Do not attack the gateway located at IP address 192.X.Y.1
- postgresql is not running by default so Metasploit may give you an error about this when starting



```
Local IP: 192.112.55.2
Target IP: 192.112.55.3
```


```
db_nmap -sS -sV -O 192.112.55.3

139/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
445/tcp open  netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
