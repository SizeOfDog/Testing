## Lab

A Kali GUI machine and a target machine running a vulnerable HTTP File Server server are provided to you. The IP address of the target machine is provided in a text file named target placed on the Desktop of the Kali machine (/root/Desktop/target).  

Your task is to fingerprint the application using the tools available on the Kali machine and then exploit the application using the appropriate Metasploit module.

Objective: Exploit the application and retrieve the flag!

Instructions:* Your Kali machine has an interface with IP address 10.10.X.Y. Run “ip addr” to know the values of X and Y. * The IP address of the target machine is mentioned in the file “/root/Desktop/target” * Do not attack the gateway located at IP address 192.V.W.1 and 10.10.X.1
