#### Privilege Escalation
	- Elevating from user to a more privileged user
	- Vital element to pentesting
	- Used to execute admin functions

#### Windows Kernel
	- Core of the operating system
	- Computer program that sits between the hardware and software
	- Windows NT is the Windows kernel
		- User Mode - Limited access to system resources
		- Kernel Mode - Allows for unlimited managing of devices and systems

#### Windows Kernel Exploitation
	- Kernel exploits target the windows kernel to execute arbitrary code
	- Process will differ based on Windows target
	- Methodology
		- Identify kernel vulns
		- Installing exploits onto the system

#### Tools
Windows-Exploit-Suggester 
	- Searched for missing patches on windows devices

Windows-Kernel-Exploits
	- Collection of windows kernel exploits

## Lab 
A Kali GUI machine and a Windows machine provided to you. 

Your task is to run [PowerUp.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1) Powershell script to find a common Windows privilege escalation flaw that depends on misconfigurations.  The [PowerSploit](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit)post-exploitation framework has provided to you on the windows machine.

Objective: Gain access to meterpreter session with high privilege.

Instructions:

- You can check the IP address of the machine by running "ipconfig" command on the command prompt i.e cmd.exe
- Do not attack the gateway located at IP address 10.0.0.1

```
nmap --script smb-protocols.nse 10.4.22.226

Host script results:
| smb-protocols: 
|   dialects: 
|     2.02
|     2.10
|     3.00
|     3.02
|_    3.11
