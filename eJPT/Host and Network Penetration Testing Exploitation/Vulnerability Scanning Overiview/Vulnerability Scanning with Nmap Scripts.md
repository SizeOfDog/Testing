## Lab

[OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) is an awareness document, which outlines the most critical security risks to web applications. Pentesting is performed according to the OWASP TOP 10 standard to reduce/mitigate the security risks.

In the exercise, we will focus on [OWASP A9 Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/OWASP_Top_Ten_2017/Top_10-2017_A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities) flaws and we perform attack against a web server which is vulnerable to [CVE-2014-6071](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2014-6271) .

Objective: Exploit the vulnerability and execute arbitrary commands on the target machine. 

Instructions: 

- This lab is dedicated to you! No other users are on this network :)
- Once you start the lab, you will have access to a Kali GUI instance.
- Your Kali instance has an interface with IP address 192.X.Y.2. Run "ip addr" to know the values of X and Y.
- Do not attack the gateway located at IP address 192.X.Y.1
