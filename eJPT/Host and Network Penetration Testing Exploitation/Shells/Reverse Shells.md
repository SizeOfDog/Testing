## Lab

Metasploit is one of the most popular pentesting tools. With features such as migrating into other processes, keylogging, etc it makes windows exploitation particularly easy. 

In this lab exercise, you are provided with GUI access to the attacker machine and the windows target machine. This allows you to experience the perspective of both the attacker and the victim at the same time. 

Your task is to exploit the application using an appropriate Metasploit module and complete the below-mentioned objectives. 

Objective: 

- Retrieve the flag.
- Create a file on the desktop which contains the text "You have been Hacked"
- From the Metasploit session, open the file in notepad on the target machine.
- Use the keylogger to log the commands typed on the victim machine.

Instructions:

- Your Kali machine has an interface with IP address 10.10.X.Y. Run “ip addr” to know the values of X and Y.
- The IP address of the target machine is mentioned in the file “/root/Desktop/target”
- Do not attack the gateway located at IP address 192.V.W.1 and 10.10.X.1
